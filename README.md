## Overview
Hospital readmissions are costly for health systems and payers. The average readmission cost in 2016 was $14.4K. That is why one of the metrics payers use to assess healthcare systems and medical providers is 30-day readmission rates. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has implemented the [Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/Readmissions-Reduction-Program) (HRRP), which incentivizes providers by tying reimbursements with readmission rates. However, according to the [Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)](https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb248-Hospital-Readmissions-2010-2016.jsp), readmission rates in the US has stayed relatively consistent from 2010 to 2016, as see in the figure below. Based on a [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2498846) conducted by the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), approximately 27% of 30-day readmissions are preventable.

## Business Understanding
ACME Health, a large payor based in Boston, MA, has hired Flatiron Consulting to help prevent their high risk patients from being readmitted to the hospital, especially those that end up in the ICU. For this project, they partnered with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA, to have access to the medical center's patient data. After reviewing the data, I have decided to create a model that utilizes the patient discharge summaries to predict whether or not the patient will likely be readmitted to the ICU within 30-days post discharge. ACME Health can use this model to help predict any future patients, so that they can focus on and follow-up with these patients post discharge.
